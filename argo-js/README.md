# â›µ Argo GraphQL

`argo-graphql` is the reference implementation of [Argo](https://msolomon.github.io/argo/),
a compact and compressible binary serialization format for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

It is written in TypeScript and distributed on NPM under the name
[argo-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argo-graphql).
The MIT-licensed source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/msolomon/argo/).

It includes a suite of test data that should be usable from other implementations (even in other languages).

Tests may be run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.
